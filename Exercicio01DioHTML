    <h2 id="season4">2014 Season</h2>
    <p>After losing at the IWC 2013, paiN decided to part ways with Espeon and pick up Minerva. With that roster, they placed second at IEM Season VIII - Sao Paulo. Then, brTT left to play for Keyd Stars and paiN fell into a rough patch, until they picked up Koreans Lactea and Olleh. With the two Korean bot laners, they won XMA - International Challenge 2014 and Razer Challenge Brasil Season 2, but fell short to Keyd Stars and to CNB e-Sports Club at Riot Brazilian Champion League 2014 and the 2014 Season Brazil Regional Finals, respectively.</p>

    <h2 id="season5p">2015 Preseason</h2>
    <p>After winning the Brazilian Qualifier (which also qualified them to the CBLOL), paiN Gaming qualified as the Brazilian team for IEM San Jose. They attended with a roster consisting of Leko, SirT, Kami, Lactea, and Olleh and were eliminated in the quarterfinals, losing to Cloud9 0-2 and tying for fifth place in the tournament with Lyon Gaming.</p>

    <h2 id="season5s">2015 Season</h2>
    <p>paiN had to release their Korean bot lane due to visa problems, and instead brought brTT and Dioud to the team. The team didn't click at first, placing fourth in the first split's regular season and then third in the playoffs. After they released Leko for Mylon, everyone had high hopes for the team, and despite a shaky start, they won the second split's playoffs, defeating INTZ Red, Keyd Stars and INTZ Team, with Kami in particular standing out as a carry of the team. They qualified for the IWCT Qualifier, and without dropping a single game the entire tournament qualified for the 2015 Season World Championship. Analyst rnglol's contributions to the team's success were particularly noted.</p>
    <p>At Worlds, paiN were seeded into Group A along with Flash Wolves, KOO Tigers, and Counter Logic Gaming. They picked up two wins in the group, against eventual group winners Flash Wolves in the first week and then against CLG in the second week, and their 2-4 overall record and 1-1 head-to-head with CLG left them tied for third place, not advancing from groups. Despite their immediate elimination, paiN's group stage run was seen as a major success: they were the first Wildcard team to win more than one game at a World Championship and also the first Wildcard team to finish higher than sole possession of last place in their group. Additionally, they looked good in some of their losses: their second game against Flash Wolves lasted 52 minutes and could have gone either way at multiple points.</p>

    <h2 id="season16-19">2016 - 2019</h2>
    <p>After the great success of 2015, paiN Gaming started to struggle over the years with multiple roster changes happening as key players such as their support Dioud left before the start of the 2016 season, brTT leaving after a dissapointing 6th place finish in the Summer and the team having to defend their spot during the promotion tournament. During the two splits in 2017 the team managed to make it to the playoffs both times. However, they were not able to secure first place. Ahead of the summer season of 2018, TinOwns became the new mid laner as Kami moved to an inactive position, and Takeshi became the new top laner as Mylon retired. These changes affected the team heavily as they finished in last place and the team ended up being relegated to the BRCC.</p>
    <p>After the relegation paiN Gaming decided to rebuild their roster only keeping TinOwns and Matsukaze. The new roster contained Ayel, Nappon, TinOwns, Matsukaze, and Dioud, who rejoined the team. This new roster finished 1st in the group stage, tied with Operation Kino and Team oNe eSports. As the team advanced easily to the finals after beating Team oNe eSports by 3-0 in the semifinals they fell short against Redemption Porto Alegre as they got swept by a 3-0 and thus not directly promoting but moving to the 2019 promotion tournament. During the promotion tournament they faced their rivals, INTZ eSports, and once again paiN Gaming got swept for a 3-0, failing to promote back to the CBLOL. Once again the team decided on two changes: Minerva rejoined the team as the new jungler and esA joined from Flamengo eSports as the support. During the Summer season of BRCC 2019 they showed why they belonged in the CBLOL as they went 13-2, tied with RED Canids for first place in the group stage, and advanced to the playoffs once again. However, this time they swept Falkol 3-0 in the semifinals and Team oNe eSports in the finals, earning their spot back into the CBLOL and finishing their returning split with a fifth place finish.</p>
